## About

Code duplication is a big issue. As developers move from from project to project we often copy and paste snippets of code between projects. While this is quick and easy its very hard to maintain.

This project is intended to act as a place where front end developers can store and share useful snippets of code.

## Usage
```console
npm i --save @bcgov/common-web-utils
```

Once you installed you can can use it like any other module:

```javascript
import { ImplicitAuthManager } from '@bcgov/common-web-utils';
```

### Available Modules
- ImplicitAuthManager: this is an SSO Implicit Auth Helper Library
- TypeCheck: (__deprecated__) this is a simple type checking library

### Further Documentation
